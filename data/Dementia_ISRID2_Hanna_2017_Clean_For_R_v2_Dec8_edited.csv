Spoke with victim had good long term memory knew her street address and phone number but thought she was with her husband and confused why I was taking her home .. Was wearing an ID bracelet for this reason but it was not used.

Had no short term memory or concept of time. Did not like answering questions. 

At home did not know how she got home or where she had been. Was on medication 

but had bad side effects and was no longer taking it.

Very fit as she walked everyday. I believe the reason she was located was 

because she came to a shopping centre or would have kept on

A team of four and one area search dog were deployed from Santa Barbara on Friday night, and stayed overnight in Mariposa. On Saturday morning the team was split up into three different teams. Two SAR team members and the search dog formed one team. The other two team members were split up and each accompanied a dog handler from another SAR team or from CARDA. All team members started from the same location, but had different assignments in different areas. Conditions and terrain differed for each team. Weather was accomodating. Teams completed their assignments between 4:30 - 6:30 pm, and were released from the incident following a debrief with Operations. We did not locate the subject. The team travelled back to Santa Barbara that evening, arriving home before midnight.Jennifer, Juanita, Mike W. and Jenna w/ Wyatt.

I went to that location with other officers to attempt to locate the missing person.  At the time we did not know if the person was missing under suspicious circumstances so we did a two pronged approach to the search, treating it as if it was a major crime as well as a missing person.  The major crimes portion was headed up by Detective Sergeant Dan Looney.  I headed up the search and rescue effort.  On the first day we had twelve SAR personnel respond.  They searched the area around the residence where it was likely the missing person would be located.  That area is a square grassy, hilly, open area consisting of about five acres that is used for farming sheep and other agricultural purposes.  It is surrounded by timber on three sides and bordered by a gravel road.  The search consisted of a grid ground search with approximately 6 feet between searchers.  We used the gravel road as the start of our search and the timber to border the end and edges.  Additionally a dog team searched several likely areas where we suspected the subject might go.  Nothing of interest was located on the first day and the search was suspended for the evening do to safety concerns.  On the second day we again had twelve SAR personnel.  We analyzed our search patterns of the first day and identified several areas that needed to be more thoroughly searched.  These were some dense brushy areas within the grid search area and locations where it was likely the victim would have gone to care for her animals.  There were several areas identified by the dog team that needed to be covered more thoroughly.  Based on this discussion, assignments were made, and the search began at approximately 0830.  At 0907 the dog team radioed in they had made voice contact with the missing person.  This was approximately one half mile from the residence, up hill, in the timber.  It was confirmed that the voice contact was that of our missing person.  Numerous Deputies and EMS responded to her location.  They found her conscious alert and talkative.  Her condition was described as hypothermic and suffering from exposure to the elements.  At the time that she was located it was raining lightly.  During the two days that she been in the woods prior to being located it had been very cold and had frozen each morning.  The victim was removed by EMS and transported to Coquille Valley Hospital where she was treated.  She was later release from the hospital but had to return one day later due to complications from the exposure.  It should be noted that preliminary information from friends and acquaintances painted a picture of a frail woman who would not walk far.  Later information from contractors who worked on the property leads us to believe that Suzie probably gets around quite well (although with a walking stick or cane).  She was fond of mushrooms and mushroom picking and was equipped for that activity when located."
